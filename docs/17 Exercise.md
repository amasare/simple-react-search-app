#Exercise

Using enhanced fruit list provided below, render an additional results list on your UI that shows which continents the filtered fruits results come from.


The two filtered results lists (fruits, and continents) should appear side by side.
The continents do not have to match to their respective fruits.
Show only one occurrence of a continent for each result
Feel free to reuse the ListComponent.


##Example Expected UI:

```
================================
            Orange
--------------------------------
Results:        | Continents:
Red Orange      | North America
Blue Orange     | Africa
                | Asia
================================
```
