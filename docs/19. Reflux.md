# Reflux

Reflux has less opinions about how you store data to state.
With reflux, you can have as many stores as you want.

React components dispatch actions, and there are stores listen for those actions.
Once those actions are dispatched, the store performs whatever method the listeners are assigned to.

To add Reflux, first add reflux to your dependencies
```
npm install reflux
```
